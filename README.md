###### Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit  / Revenue) * 100  =  90.8 %
###### Average Cycle time = 14.7 Days
###### On-Time Delivery rate =(no of on time delivey / total delivery ) * 100 = 50%
###### Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Avg Inventory value = 52.9k / 4881 = 10.6
###### Average Supplier lead time = 15.96 Days

##  Project Workflow 

#### Visualisation
This report was designed to break down the supply chain process into actionable stages, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of key performance metrics. The report comprises of 5 dashboards, where 4 of them focusses on stages like Inventory Management, Production, Logistics and After Sales.
Summary Dashboard highlights the key insights on comparing the different product categories.
Visual element like KPI cards, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, matrices, filters and bookmarks are used. Page navigation and cross report filtering adds interactivity to the visuals.


##  Key Findings
Supplier dashboard suggests Supplier1 supplied the highest no of  products and even highest no of distinct SKU and thus contributing to highest revenue.Lead time for this supplier is high so that enough quantity should be stocked. Stock levels for products from supplier3 will soon be running out of stock but the lead time from them is low.

From Manufacturing dashboard it is evident that only 23% of manufactured products passed the quality inspection on first test. Cost of maufacturing is above 90 for around 10+ products while there dependency with lead time is not that correlated.Highest production volume is for SKU76 and product with highest defect rate is SKU42

Logistics dashboard depicts the no of products, cost and shipping time of differnt carriers, modes and routes.

Sales dashboard provides correlation between top sold products and revenue,top priced products and revenue, top cost product and revenue.
Skincare products generates the maximum revenue followed by haircare and cosmetics.


##  Recommendations

* Engage with underperforming suppliers to improve delivery reliability.
* Rebalance inventory distribution to reduce stockouts in high-turnover regions.
* Minimise defect rate per product and increase product pass rate in Quality Inspection.
* Implement automated alerts for delayed shipments.
* Choose carrier, mode and routes with less lead time and minimum cost.



##  Next Steps

* Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast delays.
* Add financial impact analysis on late deliveries and stockouts.
* Expand dashboard to include customer satisfaction metrics.
