##  Key Findings
KPI  Profit 

Supplier => most SKU supplied, most order quantity supplied , lead time, stock level  
Manufacturing => pass % ,sku with max manufacturing cost, sku with max prod vol, sku with max defect rate
Logistics => depicting the no of products, cost and shipping time of differnt carriers, modes and routes
Sales => correlation between top sold products and revenue,top priced products and revenue, top cost product and revenue, top skus generated revenue


##  Recommendations

* Engage with underperforming suppliers to improve delivery reliability
* Rebalance inventory distribution to reduce stockouts in high-turnover regions
* Minimise defect rate per product and increase product pass rate in Quality Inspection.
* Implement automated alerts for delayed shipments
* Choose carrier, mode and routes with less lead time and minimum cost.



##  Next Steps

* Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast delays
* Add financial impact analysis on late deliveries and stockouts
* Expand dashboard to include customer satisfaction metrics
